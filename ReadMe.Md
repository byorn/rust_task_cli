# Task CLI

Current Progress
=================

Starting of for this project. I am going to play around for fun, with how to write a cli app.
I am not going to use AI, for every task I set for my self. I will look at AI solution after I complete the task.

1) My first approach to this problem is i will have a list of tasks, which I will add, delete and update
in separate methods.
-- 1) is completed!

2) Next I want to move these functions to a Struct as struct functions, that work on a variable inside the struct.
   (Not associated functions, but methods)
--2) is completed

3) Next I want to write unit tests the idomatic way.
4) Next I want to be able to accept command line arguments as input and accept options.
5) Next the program should not exit, until i press cntrl c.
6) Next I want to persist the tasks to a file.
